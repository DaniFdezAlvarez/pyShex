    It represents a reduced vision of a ShEx Schemma. It assigns to each type what type you could reach using
    only an edge with a concrete label.
    i.e.: with a ShEx like:

    A {
     :b B *,
     :c B +,
     :d G
    }

    We will have a ShSchemma that stores that, from type A,
    with an arist b you can reach a B; with a c, a B; with a d, a G
